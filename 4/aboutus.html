                We hold ourselves and each other accountable for demonstrating the Leadership Principles 
                through our actions every day. Our Leadership Principles describe how Amazon does business, 
                how leaders lead, and how we keep the customer at the center of our decisions. Our unique 
                Amazon culture, described by our Leadership Principles, helps us relentlessly pursue our mission 
                of being Earth's most customer-centric company, best employer, and safest place to work.

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(238, 124, 238);">Customer Obsession</h4>
        <p>Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(224, 176, 55);">Ownership</h4>
        <p>Leaders are owners. They think long term and do not sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: blue;">Invent and Simplify</h4>
        <p>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(236, 13, 13);">Are Right, A Lot</h4>
        <p>Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to challenge their beliefs.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(238, 124, 238);">Learn and Be Curious</h4>
        <p>Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: green;">Hire and Develop the Best</h4>
        <p>Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: blue;">Insist on the Highest Standards</h4>
        <p>Leaders have relentlessly high standards that many may consider unreasonably high. Leaders continually raise the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. They ensure defects are not passed down the line and that problems are fixed permanently.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(236, 13, 13);">Think Big</h4>
        <p>Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look for ways to serve customers innovatively.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: blueviolet;">Bias for Action</h4>
        <p>Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not require extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(224, 176, 55);">Earn Trust</h4>
        <p>Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when awkward or embarrassing. Leaders benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(236, 13, 13);">Dive Deep</h4>
        <p>Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: green;">Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</h4>
        <p>Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when uncomfortable or exhausting. They have conviction, are tenacious, and commit wholly once a decision is made.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(224, 176, 55);">Deliver Results</h4>
        <p>Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with quality in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(238, 124, 238);">Strive to be Earth's Best Employer</h4>
        <p>Leaders work daily to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and help others to enjoy work. Leaders ask themselves if their employees are growing, empowered, and ready for what's next.</p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section>
        <h4 style="color: blueviolet;">Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility</h4>
        <p>We started in a garage, but weâ€™re no longer there. We are big and impact the world, and we must be humble. Our actions affect our communities, the planet, and future generations. Leaders strive to make things better for our customers, partners, and the world.</p>
